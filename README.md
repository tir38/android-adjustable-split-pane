##Adjustable Split-Pane View for Android


_This is was just a goof around idea and is not meant for prime-time. Play around and have fun with it._

A custom Activity and Layout for drag-adjustable width split pane. Users can drag the divider to resize your two panes. Each pane hosts a fragment you provide.

The important parts are:
- `activity_split_pane.xml`
- 'MySplitPaneActivity.java`
